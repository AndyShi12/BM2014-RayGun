Ray Gun - BoilerMake 2014
=============

We combined iBeacon (proximity based positioning) with a QR analyzer (player details) to allow you to play real-time Assassin right on your iPhone!  
- Scalable to Laser Tag and Capture the Flag  
- Backend through nodeJS  
- Bonus, your Boilermake badge shows your life! 

Players use the app to capture the other players’ QR codes to “kill” them. Dead players must return to an iBeacon “home base” to respawn and continue playing. An LED display on an Arduino shows whether the player is alive or dead.
